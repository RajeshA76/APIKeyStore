| Method   | Endpoint              | Description                       |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/signup/`            | Register a new user               |
| `POST`   | `/login/`             | Log in with email and password    |
| `POST`   | `/set-key/`           | Set encryption key in session     |
| `GET`    | `/download-key/`      | One-time encryption key download  |
| `GET`    | `/home/`              | API key management UI             |
| `POST`   | `/apikey-store/`      | Add a new encrypted API key       |
| `GET`    | `/apikey-store/`      | List all stored API keys          |
| `DELETE` | `/apikey-store/<id>/` | Delete a specific API key         |
| `POST`   | `/decrypt-apikey/`    | Decrypt API key using session key |

### 7. Encryption Design

Each user gets a unique encryption key at signup.

Key must be downloaded immediately ‚Äî not stored on the server.

API keys are encrypted client-side using the key stored in the session.

Decryption works only when the correct encryption key is set in session.
